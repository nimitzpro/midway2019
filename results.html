            <h2>Consequences of Midway</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Loss of the Kidou Butai</h3>
                <p>This was a disastrous loss to the IJN. They had lost four fleet carriers and a heavy cruiser for one
                    American carrier. Unlike the Americans, they couldn't replace these ships quickly.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Loss of Airmen and Carrier personnel</h3>
                <h4>Japanese casualties numbered over 3000 while the USN lost only ~300 in comparison.</h4>
                <p>While Japan lost over 100 airmen, this was not too critical as they had 2000 trained pilots at the
                    start of the war. But they lost over 40% of their experienced carrier crew who knew how to operate
                    carriers effectively(refueling/repairing/rearming planes, etc.). This lack of experienced crewmen
                    would come back to haunt the IJN in the later sinkings of carriers such as Shoukaku, Hiyou and
                    Taihou.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>American Initiative</h3>
                <p>After Midway, the Japanese were forced on the defensive. While they attempted to take more territory,
                    they now faced stiff resistance from the Americans, e.g. at Guadalcanal. The USN now had air
                    superiority and it wouldn't be long before this turned to supremacy. If they had the carriers lost
                    at Midway, then they would have been able to continue offensives, or at least provide needed air
                    cover in defensive operations.</p>

                <h3>The Japanese codes had been broken.</h3>
                <p>The IJN used codebooks, unlike the German Enigma. However, the USN had already been breaking their
                    codes since the start of the war. They were due to get new codebooks before Operation MI was
                    to take place but this was delayed, leading to the successful interception of their transmissions.
                    With this information, the U.S. knew where and when the Japanese would attack.</p>

                <h3>Miscommunication on the Japanese side</h3>
                <p>An 'auxiliary fleet' of repair/transport ships was detected by the delayed spotter plane, which was
                    likely to have been the US Fleet, but due to the bad weather the spotter plane missed them. Chuuichi
                    Nagumo decided not to engage the 'auxiliary fleet' as the last time they had attacked such a fleet
                    it was indeed a transport fleet. <strong>Nagumo was later informed that there was a carrier spotted but it was too late.</strong></p>

                <h3>Radar, or the lack thereof.</h3>
                <p>While the IJN was one of the most advanced navies in the world, they were behind on radar. In June
                    1942, most of their
                    ships were not equipped with radar, and thus could not detect US aircraft. On returning to Japan
                    afte Midway, many ships began to be equipped with radar but it was too late.</p>
                <p>The US had radar and this gave the Midway garrison warning of the incoming aircraft. They could prepare somewhat for the attack unlike when the IJN carriers were attacked, which were completely surprised by the attack.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Spotting</h3>
                <p>There weren't enough spotter planes sent out to scout for the US, and there were issues with a
                    floatplane catapult on Tone, delaying the crucial spotting of US Carriers.</p>
                <p>The USN on the other hand, had known for many hours where the IJN carriers were due to spotting aircraft from Midway.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Complacency</h3>
                <p>Prior to Midway, Japan had been scoring victory after victory. Their actual battles were not as bad
                    as the wargames they had simulated, and this probably contributed to the decision to execute MI as
                    it was.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the Americans were on the losing end until Midway. They grabbed this oppurtunity.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Damage Control Efforts</h3>
                <p>The US were able to pull an already damaged carrier(Yorktown) into the battle and were able to keep it afloat for much longer due to good safety and Damage Control being taught to all crew.</p>
                <p>Contrarily, the IJN Carrier crew in general were not educated in damage control - this was left to a specialised team. This was exacerbated by the haphazard refueling and rearming that was taking place during the attack.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Bad Weather</h3>
                <p>The weather to the North-East of the Kidou Butai was not great to say the least, and this helped the USN stay
                    undetected, especially with the Japanese's lack of radar.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Shoukaku and Zuikaku were not available.</h3>
                <p>These were their most advanced carriers. Unfortunately, Shoukaku was heavily damaged in Coral Sea and
                    Zuikaku's airwing was heavily depleted. Shoukaku's planes could have been transferred to Zuikaku
                    giving them 5 carriers instead of 4, but as the carrier and air crew were part of the same unit in
                    Japanese
                    Carrier Doctrine, this was not done.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>USS Yorktown</h3>
                <p>Yorktown was heavily damaged in the Battle of the Coral Sea, and the Japanese assumed
                    that she would either be sunk or in need or substantial repair. But she was given 72 hours of
                    emergency repairs and sent to Midway along with the other carriers, levelling the playing field.
                    American carriers also carried more planes than their Japanese couterparts so together with the
                    island garrison they had almost
                    achieved parity.</p>
